# OpenSCAD Library

My library of custom models for 3D printing designed using OpenSCAD.

## Modules

All the modules are included in the _designs_ folder. These are meant to 
be used within a larger project that designs a final piece.

- **half_cube**: This module generates a triangular prism taking a half of a cube defined by xy_dim and z_dim parameters. Using cut = 50, the cutting line will go from a vertex to the opposite one.

## Designs

Designs ready to be printed.

- **planter_holder**: This design aims to be used as a holder for yogurt containers. In Spain, regular yogurt containers are perfect for growing seeds. The idea is to have some sort of structure that can hold many of this things to build a seedbed.
